#    Key Observations from the Data:
#    
#     Likes per View:
#     â€¢ Claim Videos: 
#     The mean likes_per_view ratio for claim videos is generally higher than for opinion videos across all author ban statuses. For example, active claim videos have a mean likes per view of 0.329542, while active opinion videos have a mean of 0.219744.
#     â€¢ Opinion Videos: 
#     Opinion videos have consistently lower likes_per_view ratios. This suggests that viewers are more likely to like claim videos than opinion videos, potentially because claim videos might provoke stronger reactions or resonate more with the audience.
#     
#     Comments per View:
#     â€¢ Claim Videos: 
#     The comments_per_view ratio is also slightly higher for claim videos. For example, active claim videos have a mean comments per view of 0.001393, while active opinion videos have a mean of 0.000517.
#     â€¢ Opinion Videos: 
#     Opinion videos tend to have fewer comments relative to views, suggesting that claim videos might drive more discussions or elicit stronger reactions that encourage viewers to leave comments.
#     
#     Shares per View:
#     â€¢ Claim Videos: 
#     The shares_per_view ratio for claim videos is generally higher across all author ban statuses. For instance, active claim videos have a mean shares per view of 0.065456, whereas active opinion videos have a mean of 0.043729.
#     â€¢ Opinion Videos: 
#     Similar to the other metrics, opinion videos have a lower share rate relative to their views, indicating that viewers are less likely to share opinion videos compared to claim videos. This might suggest that claim videos are perceived as more shareable, possibly because they present information or narratives that viewers find worth spreading.
#     
#     Summary of Differences:
#     â€¢ Engagement: 
#     Claim videos tend to have higher engagement rates (likes, comments, shares) relative to views compared to opinion videos across all categories of author ban status. This suggests that claim videos are more likely to provoke reactions from the audience.
#     â€¢ Shares: 
#     The higher shares_per_view ratio for claim videos indicates that they are more likely to be shared, which could contribute to their virality.
# 
#     Conclusion:
#     â€¢ Claim vs. Opinion: 
#     Claim videos generally see higher levels of engagement per view than opinion videos, indicating that they resonate more strongly with viewers. This could be due to the nature of claim content, which may provoke more reactions, discussions, and sharing than opinion-based content.
#     â€¢ Impact of Author Ban Status: 
#     The differences in engagement across banned, active, and under review authors are less pronounced, but claim videos consistently outperform opinion videos regardless of author status.
# 
# *   What percentage of the data is comprised of claims and what percentage is comprised of opinions?
#    
#    Of the 19,382 samples in this dataset, just under 50% are claimsâ€”9,608 of them.
# 
# *   What factors correlate with a video's claim status?
#       
#    Engagement level is strongly correlated with claim status. This should be a focus of further inquiry.
# 
# *   What factors correlate with a video's engagement level?
#    
#    Videos with banned authors have significantly higher engagement than videos with active authors. Videos with authors under review fall between these two categories in terms of engagement levels.
